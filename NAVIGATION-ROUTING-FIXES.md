# Navigation Routing Fixes - Complete

## Issue Resolution

### Problem
Market Information menu and submenu items were causing 404 Page Not Found errors because they used regular HTML `<a>` tags instead of proper client-side routing.

### Root Cause
The navigation component was using HTML anchor tags (`<a href="/path">`) which cause full page reloads in single-page applications, leading to routing conflicts and 404 errors.

### Solution Implemented
Converted all navigation links to use wouter's `Link` component for proper client-side routing.

## Fixed Navigation Links

### Desktop Navigation
**Properties Dropdown:**
- All Properties (/properties)
- Voice Search (/voice-search)
- Luxury Homes (/luxury-homes-las-vegas)
- Skye Canyon Guide (/skye-canyon-guide)
- Skye Canyon Schools (/skye-canyon-schools)
- Skye Canyon Parks (/skye-canyon-parks)
- New Construction (/skye-canyon-communities)

**Market Info Dropdown:**
- Market Analysis (/market-analysis)
- Neighborhood Heat Map (/neighborhood-analysis)
- Las Vegas Market (/las-vegas-real-estate)
- Northwest Las Vegas (/northwest-las-vegas)

**Main Navigation:**
- Home (/)
- About Dr. Duffy (/about)

### Mobile Navigation
All corresponding mobile menu items now use proper client-side routing with the same paths.

## Technical Changes

### Before (Problematic)
```jsx
<a href="/market-analysis" className="...">
  Market Analysis
</a>
```

### After (Fixed)
```jsx
