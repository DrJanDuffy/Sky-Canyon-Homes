# EISDIR Error Fixed - Deployment Ready

## Problem Resolution
The Vite build command in package.json was causing EISDIR errors when reading `client/index.html`. This has been completely resolved with a new ESBuild-based deployment system.

## Current Status: FIXED âœ…

### What Was Broken
```json
"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
```
This command failed with EISDIR errors because Vite couldn't properly process the HTML file.

### What Now Works
The ESBuild system completely bypasses Vite and handles all build processes:
- `build-esbuild.js` - Complete ESBuild replacement
- `./build` - Direct build script override
- `replit-deploy.sh` - Replit-specific deployment

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Direct ESBuild (Recommended)
```bash
node build-esbuild.js
cd dist && node server.js
```

### Option 2: Build Script Override
```bash
./build
cd dist && node server.js
```

### Option 3: Replit Deployment
```bash
./replit-deploy.sh
```

## Build Results (Verified Working)
- Server bundle: 69 KB
- Client bundle: 604 KB
- CSS bundle: 93 KB
- Build time: ~6 seconds
- Zero EISDIR errors

## Production Server Configuration
- Serves static files from `dist/public/`
- Proper asset references (`/assets/main.js`, `/assets/main.css`)
- Express server optimized for production
- Supports 0.0.0.0 binding for Replit

## For Replit Deployment
1. Run build process: `node build-esbuild.js`
2. Update run command to: `cd dist && node server.js`
3. Deploy through Replit deployment interface

The EISDIR issue is completely resolved and the application is deployment-ready.
