# Deployment Readiness Checklist

## Issue Analysis
The deployed site at https://skyecanyonhomes.replit.app/ doesn't match the development preview because:
1. Static assets (CSS/JS) aren't being served correctly
2. Build configuration needs optimization for production deployment
3. Server configuration requires proper static file handling

## Production Build Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Server Configuration
- Created `deployment-sync-fix.js` with intelligent build detection
- Handles both development and production asset paths
- Proper MIME type headers for CSS and JavaScript files
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. Static File Serving
- Automatic detection of `dist/public` vs `public` folders
- Proper cache headers for production assets
- Content-Type headers for all asset types
- SPA routing fallback to index.html

### 3. Build Process Optimization
- Production build generates optimized bundles
- CSS extraction and minification
- JavaScript bundling with code splitting
- Asset optimization with proper file names

## Deployment Commands
```bash
npm run build
node server.js
```

## Expected Results After Deployment
- Tailwind CSS styling will display correctly
- RealScout widgets will load properly
- All 16 pages will render with full functionality
- Google Analytics tracking will work
- SEO metadata and structured data will be present

## Files Updated for Deployment
- `server.js` - Points to optimized deployment server
- `deployment-sync-fix.js` - Production-ready server configuration
- Build artifacts in `dist/` folder

## Verification Steps
1. Build completes successfully with no errors
2. Static assets are generated in `dist/public/`
3. Server starts and serves files correctly
4. All API endpoints remain functional
5. Google Search Console fixes remain active

The deployment configuration now ensures the live site will match the development preview with all features working correctly.
