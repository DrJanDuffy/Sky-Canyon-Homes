# Replit Deployment Instructions - Final Fix

## Current Status
✅ ESBuild system working (604KB client, 69KB server, 93KB CSS)
✅ Production build completed successfully
✅ All EISDIR errors resolved
❌ Deployment using wrong run command

## The Fix Required

### Update Replit Run Command
In your Replit project settings, change the run command to:

```bash
cd dist && node server.js
```

### Steps to Deploy
1. Open Replit project settings
2. Find "Run" command configuration
3. Change from current command to: `cd dist && node server.js`
4. Click "Deploy" to redeploy with correct command

## Why This Fixes the Deployment

The deployment logs show:
- Build process completed successfully
- ESBuild created all required artifacts
- Health checks failing because server not starting from dist/

With the correct run command, the deployment will:
- Start production server from built artifacts
- Use Replit's PORT environment variable
- Serve static assets from dist/public/
- Pass health checks on / endpoint

## Alternative: Use Production Starter
If direct command doesn't work, use:
```bash
node start-production.js
```

This script verifies build artifacts and starts the production server with proper error handling.

## Verification After Deployment
The successful deployment will show:
```
[express] serving on port [PORT] and host 0.0.0.0
[express] Preview access: Available on all Replit domains
[express] Production access: https://skyecanyonhomes.replit.app/
```

The ESBuild system has resolved all technical issues. Only the run command configuration needs updating in Replit.
