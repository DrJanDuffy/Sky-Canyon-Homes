# Vercel Deployment Sync for Task Master AI
## Skye Canyon Real Estate Platform

### Current Status
Your Vercel deployment at https://sky-canyon-homes.vercel.app/ is running but missing the Task Master AI integration. The deployment needs to be updated with the latest changes.

### Missing Components in Production
- Task Master AI endpoints (`/api/tasks`, `/api/tasks/dashboard`, `/api/automations`)
- Task dashboard interface at `/task-dashboard`
- Automation workflows and task management system
- Real estate workflow automation features

### Deployment Sync Process

#### Step 1: Commit Changes to Repository
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Task Master AI integration for Skye Canyon real estate"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Trigger Vercel Deployment
Your Vercel deployment will automatically rebuild when you push to the main branch. The deployment process will:

1. Install task-master-ai package and 305 dependencies
2. Build the task dashboard interface
3. Deploy the API endpoints for task management
4. Enable automation workflows for real estate operations

#### Step 3: Verify Deployment
After deployment completes, verify these endpoints:
- `https://sky-canyon-homes.vercel.app/api/tasks/dashboard`
- `https://sky-canyon-homes.vercel.app/task-dashboard`
- `https://sky-canyon-homes.vercel.app/api/automations`

### Expected Production Features

#### Task Management Dashboard
- Real-time task monitoring for 6 categories
- Property management workflow automation
- Lead generation and AI scoring system
- SEO optimization tracking for Skye Canyon keywords
- Performance monitoring with response time tracking
- CRM synchronization automation

#### Automation Workflows
1. **Lead Capture**: Automatic AI scoring and CRM sync on form submissions
2. **Property Updates**: Hourly cache refresh and sitemap generation
3. **Performance Audits**: Daily SEO monitoring and optimization checks

#### API Endpoints
- Task CRUD operations with real-time updates
- Dashboard metrics for business intelligence
- Automation trigger endpoints for manual workflow execution
- Integration with existing property and lead management systems

### Production Environment Variables
Ensure these are configured in Vercel:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Supabase connection string
- `FUB_API_KEY` - Follow Up Boss API key (requires renewal)
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - AI integration for lead scoring
- `SUPABASE_KEY` - Database access credentials

### Task Master AI Configuration
The following files need to be included in deployment:
- `taskmaster.json` - Project configuration
- `server/task-manager.ts` - Backend task management
- `client/src/pages/task-dashboard.tsx` - Dashboard interface
- Task automation workflows and database integration

### Business Impact After Deployment
- Automated lead processing with AI scoring
- Real-time property listing performance monitoring
- Continuous SEO optimization for Las Vegas market positioning
- Streamlined workflow management for real estate operations
- Enhanced client engagement through automated follow-up systems

The deployment will provide enterprise-grade task automation specifically designed for Las Vegas Skye Canyon real estate operations, integrating seamlessly with your existing property management and lead generation systems.
