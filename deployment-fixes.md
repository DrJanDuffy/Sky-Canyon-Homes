# Deployment CSS and RealScout Widget Fixes

## Issues Identified in Deployed Site:
1. **CSS Not Loading**: Tailwind styles not appearing properly
2. **RealScout Widget**: Not displaying property listings
3. **Static Files**: Production build assets not serving correctly

## Fixes Implemented:

### 1. Production Build Configuration
- Created optimized `start.js` for production deployment
- Configured proper static file serving with correct MIME types
- Added Content-Type headers for CSS and JS files

### 2. RealScout Widget Enhancement
- Updated script loading with `defer` attribute for better compatibility
- Enhanced CSP headers to allow RealScout domains
- Added widget detection attributes

### 3. Security Headers Update
- Modified CSP to allow all RealScout subdomains (`https://*.realscout.com`)
- Changed X-Frame-Options to SAMEORIGIN for iframe support
- Added proper CORS headers for widget communication

### 4. Static File Serving
- Configured Express static middleware with cache headers
- Added proper content-type detection for assets
- Implemented fallback to index.html for SPA routing

## Deployment Commands:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## File Updates:
- `/start.js` - Production server configuration
- `/server/middleware.ts` - Enhanced security headers
- `/client/src/components/global-realscout-widget.tsx` - Widget loading improvements

## Expected Results:
- Tailwind CSS styling will display correctly
