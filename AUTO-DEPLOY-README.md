# Automated Git Push for Deployment

Your Skye Canyon real estate website now automatically syncs with GitHub when you deploy. This ensures your code is always backed up and version-controlled.

## What's New

When you deploy your site, the system now:
- Automatically commits your latest changes
- Pushes code to your GitHub repository
- Maintains a complete deployment history
- Shows deployment status in the web interface

## Quick Setup

1. **Connect your GitHub repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/skye-canyon-realestate.git
   ```

2. **Manual sync before deployment**:
   ```bash
   node replit-deploy-sync.js --sync
   ```

3. **Deploy normally** using Replit's Deploy button

## Features Added

### Deployment Status Dashboard
- Shows in bottom-right corner of your website
- Displays Git configuration status
- One-click manual sync to GitHub
- Real-time sync status updates

### Automated Scripts
- `replit-deploy-sync.js` - Main sync script
- `deploy-with-git-sync.sh` - Shell version
- API endpoints for status checking and manual triggers

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/deployment-status` - Check Git configuration
- `POST /api/trigger-git-sync` - Manual GitHub sync

## How It Works

1. **Before deployment**: Code automatically commits with timestamp
2. **During deployment**: Changes push to your GitHub repository
3. **After deployment**: Status updates in the dashboard

## Benefits

- **Code backup**: Never lose your work
- **Version control**: Track all changes over time
- **Team collaboration**: Share code through GitHub
- **CI/CD ready**: Enable automated workflows
- **Deployment history**: See what was deployed when
