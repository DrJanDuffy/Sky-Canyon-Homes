# Automated Git Push After Successful Deployment

Your Skye Canyon real estate website now automatically syncs with GitHub only after successful deployments. This ensures failed deployments don't get pushed to your repository.

## What's New

The system now triggers Git sync ONLY after successful deployment:
- Waits for deployment completion before syncing
- Only pushes code to GitHub if deployment succeeds
- Creates deployment records with timestamps
- Shows deployment status in the web interface
- Prevents unsuccessful deployments from reaching GitHub

## Quick Setup

1. **Connect your GitHub repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/skye-canyon-realestate.git
   ```

2. **Manual sync before deployment**:
   ```bash
   node replit-deploy-sync.js --sync
   ```

3. **Deploy normally** using Replit's Deploy button

## Features Added

### Deployment Status Dashboard
- Shows in bottom-right corner of your website
- Displays Git configuration status
- One-click manual sync to GitHub
- Real-time sync status updates

### Automated Scripts
- `replit-deploy-sync.js` - Main sync script
- `deploy-with-git-sync.sh` - Shell version
- API endpoints for status checking and manual triggers

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/deployment-status` - Check Git configuration
- `POST /api/trigger-git-sync` - Manual GitHub sync

## How It Works

1. **Deploy normally**: Use Replit's Deploy button as usual
2. **After successful deployment**: System automatically triggers GitHub sync
3. **Post-deployment sync**: Creates timestamped commit and pushes to GitHub
4. **Status updates**: Dashboard shows sync status and deployment history

## Deployment Workflow

1. Make your code changes in Replit
2. Click Deploy in Replit
3. **Wait for deployment to complete successfully**
4. System automatically syncs to GitHub (only on success)
5. Check dashboard for sync confirmation

## Benefits

- **Code backup**: Never lose your work
- **Version control**: Track all changes over time
- **Team collaboration**: Share code through GitHub
- **CI/CD ready**: Enable automated workflows
- **Deployment history**: See what was deployed when

## Files Created
