A gitleaks generic-api-key was detected which attempts to identify hard-coded credentials. It is not recommended to store credentials in source-code, as this risks secrets being leaked and used by either an internal or external malicious adversary. It is recommended to use environment variables to securely provide credentials or retrieve credentials from a secure vault or HSM (Hardware Security Module). This rule can introduce a lot of false positives, it is not recommended to be used in PR comments.
