Looking at your server logs, I can identify several critical issues affecting your real estate application's performance and accessibility. Let me break down the problems and provide targeted solutions.
Critical Performance Issues Identified
Primary Bottleneck: Your /api/properties endpoint is taking 4.7 seconds to respond, which is causing cascading performance problems including a poor First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric of 4.7 seconds.
Secondary Issues:

Multiple endpoints returning empty arrays, suggesting potential data pipeline problems
Connection refused errors indicating infrastructure/deployment issues

Immediate Action Plan
1. Resolve Properties Endpoint Performance (Priority 1)
Root Cause Analysis: The 4.7-second response time suggests either:

Database query optimization issues
Missing database indexes
Network latency to external data sources
Inefficient data processing logic

Immediate Solutions:
javascript// Add request timing and logging to identify bottlenecks
app.get('/api/properties', async (req, res) => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  console.log('Properties request started');
  
  try {
    // Add database query timing
    const dbStart = Date.now();
    const properties = await getProperties(); // Your existing logic
    console.log(`DB query took: ${Date.now() - dbStart}ms`);
    
    res.json(properties);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Properties endpoint error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  } finally {
    console.log(`Total request time: ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);
  }
});
2. Fix Connectivity Issues (Priority 2)
The "refused to connect" error typically indicates:

Replit deployment configuration issues
Port binding problems
Application crash during startup

Diagnostic Steps:

Check Replit console for deployment errors
Verify your application is binding to the correct host and port:

javascriptconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
3. Implement Performance Monitoring
Add comprehensive timing to identify specific bottlenecks:
javascript// Middleware for request timing
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.startTime = Date.now();
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = Date.now() - req.startTime;
    if (duration > 1000) { // Log slow requests
      console.log(`Slow request: ${req.method} ${req.path} - ${duration}ms`);
    }
  });
  next();
});
Data Pipeline Investigation
Your endpoints returning empty arrays ([]) suggest potential issues with:

Database connectivity
API key configuration for external data sources
Data seeding/migration problems

Verification Steps:

Test database connection independently
Verify external API credentials
Check data population scripts

Performance Optimization Strategy
Short-term (1-2 days):

Implement database query logging
Add response caching for static data
Optimize database indexes

Medium-term (1 week):

Implement lazy loading for property images
Add pagination to reduce payload size
Consider CDN for static assets

Long-term (2-4 weeks):

Implement database query optimization
Add Redis caching layer
Consider serverless architecture migration

Monitoring and Alerting
Set up proactive monitoring:
javascript// Performance threshold alerts
const PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD = 2000; // 2 seconds
if (responseTime > PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD) {
  // Log to monitoring service or send alert
  console.warn(`Performance alert: ${endpoint} took ${responseTime}ms`);
}
Would you like me to help you implement any of these solutions, or do you need assistance investigating specific aspects of your application architecture?
